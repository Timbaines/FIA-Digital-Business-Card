### Meet Andy
I’ve been volunteering with Friends in Action Intl. since 2002 and have had the opportunity to work on multiple field projects around the world. I’ve been blessed to marry my high school sweetheart, raise two children, and own my own business. Since 1994 I’ve worked in the welding and fabrication industry, experiencing both hands-on and management roles throughout the years. After years of executive management and entrepreneurship, God has called me into full time ministry with FIA. Now as COO of FIA International I’m responsible for domestic operations of FIA USA  which includes staff support, communications, finance, IT, shipping, HR, and risk management. I also manage public relations and leadership/team development. I do what I love and I do it for Jesus!
